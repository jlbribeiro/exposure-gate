All you need is a vehicle that is integrated with the Mercedes API and you're in business.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nWe initially had an broader aim, but we realised we are much more interested in the challenges for the corporate sector, and theiir potential, rathaer than the consumer sector. For this reason we shifted some of our goals and achievements and foccus now on designing the business for the coporte world.\n\n## Base project \u2013 The Dashboard (10000 EXP)\n \nOur plan started small, and this is its inception.\n\nAs faithful participants of Pixels Camp we were front and centre at the keynote session and were immediately struck by the Mercedes challenge to use their new API. Our first thoughts were simple: \"Let's do a dashboard for that.\".\n\nWe were greatly excited and visited to booth to talk to the Mercedes representatives and get more out of what their new product could do. After a long and interesting conversation our minds started pumping out a lot more words and many of those started to look like ideas, until we had a lot.\n\nThe dashboard is obvious, but we need to have it and start somewhere. The application will have a centralised dashboard were you can access and interact with the available features of the Mercedes API. You will have access to the data in a visual aspect and be able to query it (human style) to gather more insights.\n\nThe dashboard will feature an alert interface with push notifications for noteworthy events happening to the vehicle or that need to happen (e.g. vehicle needs servicing).\n\nDashboard contents:\n- Map with locations\n- Fleet short summary\n- Insights (configurable):\n-- Number of vehicles in need of servicing\n-- Number of vehicles with low fuel, oil or any other metric\n\n### Vehicle vision\n\nThe dashboard will have a view for a specific vehicle where there will be a lot more detailed information for that vehicle and where actions can be taken on that vehicle, such as:\n- Block\n- Lock doors and close windows\n- Restrict driving area\n- Etc. (everything the API can handle)\n\nAlongside these actions you will be able to see the car's **Health Status** in dept.\n\n### Access control and Activity log\n\nControl which of your employees can access the dashboard and the information they see. This allows you to have a layer of privacy and security under your control and customization.\n\nKnow who made what or was involved with the vehicle. Drivers can log works hours and have driving hour reports automatically.\n\n## SmartFleet Design\n\nFind more on the [repository](https://github.com/xipasduarte/smartfleet-design) about what we are planning.\n\n## The Team\n\nWe are a small, but dedicated team of passionate engineers that like to work with data and impact the world with the knowledge we gather.

Get your ticket from Fastlane!\n\nOur product provides customers with a single interface for their mobility. It gives them the freedom to chose where they want to go, it informs them how to get there and it charges them one single time.\n\nOne ticket to take you anywhere and everywhere.\n\nBy using our crypto token (UMT), you are able to pay in any country, independently from the local currency. You can top up your UMT balance using with cryptocurrency or traditional payment methods.\n\n---\n\n# Technical Overview\n## Currency\nFastlane has its own digital currency \u201cUnified Mobility Token\u201d (UMT), which runs on the ethereum blockchain, to manage transactions between customers and transport service providers. When the user installs the app, a private/public key pair is generated offline and securely stored on the device. With these credentials, the users are then able to sign transactions on the blockchain, and therefore, able to buy and spend UMT. Fastlane does not keep their user\u2019s private keys, which means the users are responsible for keeping them safe.\n\n## Spending\nUsers are able to top up their UMT balance by sending Ether to the wallet\u2019s public address and then converting it to UMT. If they prefer to top up using another currency, we plan to use the Shapeshift to handle conversion between that currency and UMT. In the case of tradicional payment services, we can act as exchange and seamlessly fund the users with UMT.\n\n## Instant Transactions\nTransactions on the blockchain are still not there on what concerns instant payments. While we wait for technologies like lightning network and plasma to make it possible to handle instant transactions on a public blockchain, we plan to use intermediary software between the apps and the public blockchain, so that we are able to provide a faster service.\n\n## Backend\nIntegration with service providers would be handled ad-hoc on a first iteration, and as the platform usage and customer base increases, a public API would be released, so that any transportation service provider is able to integrate their own system with the fastlane platform.\n\n## Using Fastlane Tickets\nDepending on the transport provider infrastructure, users are able to purchase their tickets in advance with UMT, or Pay on the go. For the first method, our strategy is to generate a QR code containing information shared between the transport service provider and the user. Also, a public blockchain record which ties the user to that ticket id would be created. Service providers are responsible for handling validating the tickets, as part of their commute logistics. For the pay as you go method, we plan to expose an NFC interface on our application, which would then integrate with the different provider infrastructures, much in the style of contactless payments.\n", "name": "Fastlane", "created_at": "2017-09-28 18:44:37.233000", "wallet": "c717996c16f8f70c37e3dbcc93eb933836e58770"}, {"users": [{"avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/21674677?v=4", "user": "alexdsmartins", "name": "Alexandre Martins"}, {"avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/958819?v=4", "user": "chrisgrabinski", "name": "Christopher Grabi\u0144ski"}, {"avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21694860?v=4", "user": "nnunobm", "name": "Nuno Martins"}, {"avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/679335?v=4", "user": "johnsardine", "name": "Jo\u00e3o Sardinha"}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/Zn7n152.png", "repo": "", "owner": "alexdsmartins", "intro": "A global open-access history database for correlation research.", "video": "", "active": true, "id": 41, "description": "History research is a complicated process.

", "video": "", "active": true, "id": 15, "description": "\n# The Idea\n*Eating is not about the money, and it shouldn't be.* \n\nIt's about the joy of cooking, gathering around a table and sharing a meal. Its intrinsic value should be on the idea of the meal itself and the social interaction that arises, not really about how much \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac it costs.\n\nQoop is the app that makes it all possible, allowing everyone to share meals, getting other meals in return, disregarding monetary transactions and focusing on creating a parallel, _de-centralized Ethereum-based token economy for meal-sharing that holds itself together with the reliability of Smart Contracts._\n\nOn top of that, we also try to make the world a slightly better place.\n\n# How it Works\n_Qoop makes it easy to share meals with your friends, co-workers and neighbours._\n\nWhen you're cooking and notice you've made enough for a few extra guests, just fire up the app and create a new shared meal. Every one of your friends using the app will be notified that something _yummy_ is cooking and can join in. Unless all the spots are taken. In that case, better luck next time.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitesmith/qoop/master/app/assets/images/description-1.png)\n\n_But sharing isn't just taking. It's also giving back._\n\nTo join a meal, guests have to make sure the host gets a bit more than their delightful presence. In Qoop, meals are shared using `FUD`, a decentralized coin living on the Ethereum network. `1 FUD -> 1 Meal`, no exceptions, because memorable dinners are not the expensive ones, but the fun, the romantic, the lively, the bohemian ones.\n\nAt the end of the meal, everyone confirms that it was as awesome as expected, and the host gets his `FUD`. Now the cycle can keep going on and on, trading tokens for engaging meals, conversations and memories.\n\n_But where does `FUD` come from?_\n\nMeals can't be given away for free (unfortunately), so to get those first `FUD` tokens to get you started, guests and cooks alike can just fire up the app and trade `ETH` for tokens. The value is symbolic (`0.015 ETH -> 1 FUD`) and gets a lot more done than you're thinking right now. Just keep reading and you'll see.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitesmith/qoop/master/app/assets/images/description-2.png)\n\n# Sharing Locally and Globally\n\nIn our vision food is fuel, but meals are nurture and a pillar for our intrinsic social nature. With the meal sharing portion of the app, we hope to connect those that have enough to share in meaningful moments.\n\n_However, we are deeply aware that not everyone has enough to eat, much less to share._ So let's take the opportunity given to us by Qoop, and change it.\n\nThe opportunity we are presented with is `ETH`, the one that is spent to buy `FUD` tokens. From the pool of `ETH` collected through the app, _the Qoop team pledges to give 50% of the collected `ETH` to charitable foundations that help feed those that can't feed themselves._ In a way, when you're getting your tokens, you are getting meals for yourself, but also for someone that really can't afford it.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitesmith/qoop/master/app/assets/images/description-3.png)\n\nWhat about the other 50%? For us this isn't about the profit, so we reserve that 50% for users that want to exchange their `FUD` back to `ETH` (at half the exchange rate, to account for the donated slice). So if you're a serial cooker, don't worry, you won't be swimming in so much `FUD` you won't breathe.\n\n### Qoop in a nutshell\n* Forget about the money and trade meals directly for other meals.\n* Fund charities with goodwill money.\n* Enjoy the conversation, the food, and laughs with your friends and colleagues.\n\nQoop is now available at [http://qoop.herokuapp.com](http://qoop.herokuapp.com). It's one of those _heavy alpha_ versions, but go ahead and give it a spin.\n\n# Under the Hood\n\n_Now for the nitty-gritty. GH Repo is here - https://github.com/whitesmith/qoop_\n\n### FUD\nThe `FUD` token is an [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) compliant token, living for now in the Pixels Camp Ethereum Testnet. You can find the smart contract living at `0x00776a1d0759cb697111b0132731d058f3e67299`. If you want you can see [the source code for the contract](https://github.com/whitesmith/qoop/tree/master/contracts), as well as its JSON interface so you can call it directly if you want.\n\nAdditionally to the ERC20 methods, this contract also specifies the `buy` and `sell`methods to make the `ETH <-> EXP` transactions and a couple of extra functions to deal with creating and managing meals.\n\nThis contract is defined so half the received `ETH` is credited to its owner, so the charitable donations can be performed using `ETH` or some fiat currency. In the future we hope to be able to interact with other smart contracts deployed by charities, so we can keep accountability at a maximum.\n\n### Meal Contracts\nShared meals are defined as a [separate contract](https://github.com/whitesmith/qoop/blob/master/contracts/MealContract.sol) that is instantiated every time someone creates a new meal. So every shared meal is a separate contract where cooks and guests can interact to join, approve and close the meal.\n\nWhile this contract is active, all the `FUD` associated with it is held in escrow by the contract itself. When all participants approve the meal (after it happens), all the `FUD` tokens are transferred to the cook and the contract self destructs.\n\n### Web/Mobile App\nThe Qoop app is built using Ruby on Rails, for a bare-bones backend where we can store additional information regarding meals. Since all the business logic is done in the smart contract themselves, most of the data stored is cosmetic (pictures, names, descriptions).\n\nInteraction with the smart contracts is done on the client side, using [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), with optional interactions with Metamask for transaction signing.\n\nTo get it looking pretty for the PC and mobile, we built it over [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) which is pretty awesome according to both our engineers and our designers.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Q: Can you shed some light on how this idea came to be?**\n\n_A: Basically, a couple of months ago a couple of the idle minds at [Whitesmith](https://www.whitesmith.co/) thought that it would be cool to make an app to help with sharing homemade meals at the office. Like most ideas by idle minds, that never came to be._\n\n_When we got the word that Pixels Camp was gonna revolve around Blockchain, we thought it would be the perfect time to finally get the idea off the ground and get our feet wet on Ethereum and Smart Contracts (yep, first timers in `ETH` here, please be don't be harsh)._\n\n**Q: This is pretty cool, but can I get a TL;DR?**\n\n_A: Well, you basically stop paying for meals with money and start trading it for other meals. In the process you feed hungry people and if everyone starts using it, soon eating a meal will be a completely money-free event._\n\n\n**Q: Are you really donating anything to charity? What keeps you from hoarding the `ETH` to yourself?**\n\n_A: Right now, no, we are not donating. Mainly because this still lives in the Pixels Camp Testnet and the `ETH` here is worthless. And when we migrate this to the real deal, we are looking at a more accountable approach to donating, like transferring the `ETH` directly to a charity. Ideally, it would go towards some smart contract enforcing humanitarian aid for hunger relief._\n\n\n**Q: Isn't the meal contract a bit barebones? Shouldn't info on the meal also live on the blockchain?**\n\n_A: Great question, and one we haven't been able to figure out ourselves. Right now we can see that more information on the meal (at least location and short description) should be stored, to prevent tampering with the contract. But we also get that storing too much data on the blockchain is expensive (gas), so we were left wondering. If you're able to help us out here, we'd love to chat._\n\n**Q: This project is awesome and I want to help! Is this going to live past Pixels Camp?**\n_A: We certainly hope so, as half of its interest resides on it dealing with real value that can be put to good use. Reach out to us on `#qoop` on the Pixels Camp Slack, on [Github](https://github.com/whitesmith/qoop) or just talk to us directly, this is one of those projects that thrives on community, so come help._\n\n## Backer Rewards\n\n_Are there any backer rewards?_\n\nWell, all our funders are more than welcome to join us for a meal at our HQ in Coimbra or at the next Pixels Camp.
